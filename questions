<!-- If we put the cats in an array we should be able to place them randomly, but how
do we check if the mouse and cats collide then? and can we still make the size
of the cats grow (the closer they get) even if we don't know what cat that will
be displayed? -->

<!-- We could make only one button for starting the game and change the
innerText in the button to restart after the first click, right? -->
